## A Case Study On An Insuretech Company Called Marshmalow

#How the idea started.
The company was started when 2 founders Oliver Kent-Braham David Goate were a part of a separate startup together when their friend tried to get insurance. They then realized how complicated this was and they came to the conclusion that they could create a better insurance company. The founders of marshmallow believe the industry worked from a default place of distrust and the industry judges people based on impersonal and outdated systems.

#how the company started.
Marshmallow is a company started in the UK in 2017 to provide auto insurance in a more technological way. They raised $85 million in funding valuing the company at $1.25 billion. The cash came solely from existing investors, including Passion Capital.

#breaking into the amrket.
The targeted customers for this company are people who have cars and need auto insurance. In their country of origin (United Kingdom) that is approximately 47 million people. This company seeks to break into competition against traditional auto insurance companies by offering more personalized insurance therefore providing better rates. Marshmallow hopes to break into the fintech industry by obtaining and using big data to better personalize in an ancient industry of insurance. Marshmallow also puts a lot of technology resources and information into mitigating fraud and risk which also allows the company to have very competitive rates.

#company and industry growth.
In the domain of insurtech many companies have trended into doing more online business and marketing allowing for big growth in employment and policy holders. Marshmallow has grown over 200% over a six month period in 2021 and a total of 1680% over 5 years.Other companies in this industry include Kin Insurance, Zego, and Ladder. From 2017 to 2022 Marshmallow has provided policies to over 100,000 people in the United Kingdom. A main metric companies use to gauge success is the percentage of growth over a period of 5 years. For instance the 1680% growth Marshmallow had which compares well to a company like Ladder that only has 128% growth but falls short if you compare it to a company like Kin Insurance that has grown a whopping 3233%. 

#Recommendations.
Even though Marshmallow is based in the UK and that is their only base of customer's, I feel as if they would benefit from taking their 1 billion dollar company and reinvesting it in more promotions and advertisements. Also expanding to other parts of the world with a backed name and the technology foundation they have, this would allow for big growth. Marshmallow could utilize big data and data protection to insure security and provide personalized insurance.
